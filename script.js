/*Create an application that records employee salaries
and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. */

// The application should have an input form that collects employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.

//A 'Submit' button should collect the form information
// store the information to calculate monthly costs
// append information to the DOM
// clear the input fields

// Using the stored information
// calculate monthly costs
// append this to the to DOM

// Hard Mode -- Create a delete button
// Hard Mode -- that removes an employee from the DOM
// Hard Mode -- it does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total

// Pro Mode -- Once the employee is deleted, update the total spend on salaries account for this employee's removal.
// This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. 
// Look into jQuery's .data() function. 
// You will need to do something both when the employee is added
// and when they are deleted.
